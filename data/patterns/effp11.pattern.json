	"definition": "Including intriguing game elements can help distract players with a brain injury from the fact that they are performing activities physically difficult for them (e.g. standing).",
	"problem": "Therapists may use games to promote patients' endurance (e.g. standing endurance).

A less engaging gaming experience will discourage the efforts to practice for an extended time.",
