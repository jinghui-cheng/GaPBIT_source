	"problem": "Practicing dynamic balance often includes activities involving weight shifting (side-to-side and/or front-to-back). Patients who are rehabilitating on dynamic balance and weight shifting abilities often have coordination issues that affect their reaction time to events.",
	"solution": "Allow players to adjust the timing of weight shifting according to their own coordination and balancing abilities. Do not impose fix-paced actions.",
