{
	"name": "Fine Control",
	"definition": "Focusing on precision of action and promoting refined control on physical activities in game tasks can help patients with a brain injury practice certain physical abilities.",
	"problem": "Given for granted, a typical person may find certain actions (e.g. weight shifting) easy to perform. However, patients with a brain injury would have to exert a considerable amount of physical and cognitive efforts to practice these abilities. A conscious awareness of certain body movements facilitated through refined control is crucial for rehabilitating on these actions. But patients with a brain injury may lack this kind of awareness and control. Practicing fine control is thus important for improving related physical abilities.",
	"solution": "Involve mechanics to encourage fine control on physical activities that focus on precision of action and awareness of movements. For example, a refined control on the direction and degree of weight shifting is important for patients to improve weight-shifting precision and thus improve balance and gait.",
