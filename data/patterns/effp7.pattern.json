	"name": "Minimalist Task",
	"definition": "Involving minimalist but interesting player choices in the game task can promote attention and concentration for patients with a brain injury.",
	"problem": "Patients sometimes have a limited attention and concentration span that needs to be addressed in therapy. A game that involves complicated tasks (e.g. tasks that involve multiple steps) will be too challenging for them to understand and learn. However, if a game is too simple and dry, player can easily lose interest.",
	"solution": "Provide simple tasks that involve a minimal number of possible player actions or action steps; but on the other hand pose an appropriate level of challenge on the control of the attributes of the actions (e.g. timing or intensity) to promote concentration.",
