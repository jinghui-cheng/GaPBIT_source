	"name": "Optimal/Adjustable Pace",
	"definition": "When focusing on improving processing speed, allowing players to adjust the pace of game events can accommodate different patient abilities .",
	"problem": "When working on processing speed, a relatively fast-paced game is usually desired. But setting an appropriate game speed can be tricky since all patients have different abilities and impairments. While a game that is too fast can be intimidating and not playable by many patients, a game that is too slow may sometimes not be able to pose enough challenge for high-level patients and thus can be ineffective at addressing the desired therapeutic goals.",
	"solution": "Allowing therapists or patients to adjust the pace (or automatically adjust the pace) of the game. While many commercial games do not have the desired adjustable features, therapists identified that adding such feature to games that were effective at addressing Processing Speed can potentially benefit a wider range of patients.",
