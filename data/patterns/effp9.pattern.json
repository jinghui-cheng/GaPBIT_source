{
	"name": "Unpredictable Events",
	"definition": "Making game events somewhat unpredictable can promote perception, reaction, and hand-eye coordination abilities for patients with a brain injury.",
	"problem": "Practicing hand-eye coordination abilities usually involves perception and reaction to events. A game with periodical or predicable events can limit its effectiveness on rehabilitation of hand-eye coordination abilities.",
	"solution": "Make events appear in a somewhat unpredictable manner to introduce uncertainty in the game. A fairly fast pace is often desired but the speed needs to match patient abilities. A human opponent with a matching skill or an adjustable computer opponent can sometimes provide unpredictable events in an appropriate pace.",
