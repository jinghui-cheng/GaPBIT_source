	"problem": "It usually takes longer for a patient who had a brain injury to get ready to meet more difficult challenges even if they have learned the basics of a game. It takes longer for them to master the basics and come up with variations to solve new challenges.",

			"pattern-description": "The first level is relatively easy - there is only one ball and one hole and shape of the table is simple. The second level suddenly becomes too difficult for many patients - there are two balls and each time one ball falls, the table turns and may shake out the other ball. The fifth level is then extremely difficult for even the typical people - there are bumps that players have to carefully roll the balls over. None of the patients we studied with could pass the fifth level."
