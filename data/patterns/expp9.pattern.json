	"definition": "Patients who have had a brain injury can cover a wide range of age groups. A successful game for brain injury rehabilitation usually has a theme that is appropriate to the players' age group.",
	"problem": "Patients who have had a brain injury can range in age from teenagers to very elderly people. Players would not enjoy a game if they feel the theme is too na√Øve or childish or too serious.",
	"solution": "Provide age-appropriate theme according to the target player's age group. If desired (and if possible), cater both young and elderly people's taste. For example, there are people from all age groups who like to dance, but only to their favorite songs. (i.e. old and young people have different tastes on music and songs); so provide a collection of hit songs from different periods can cater different age groups.",
